# INT2 Group Assessment

## Description
A neural network classifier, that takes an image as its input, and predicts a specific class as its output. Our neural network has been trained on the CIFAR-10 training set, and has been evaluated on the official CIFAR-10 test set. We have prepared a report in the style of a short academic research paper, presenting our method and results.
